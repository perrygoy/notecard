# Notecard

Notecard (Note ðŸŽ¶ + flashcard)
helps you read music!

You can choose which instrument you want to practice with,
then Notecard will show you a note. ðŸŽ¼
After a few seconds,
if Notecard has not heard that note,
Notecard will show you which
key/fret/button
to press to make that note on the instrument.
